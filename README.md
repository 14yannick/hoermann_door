**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

# Overview

This repo contains the pcb files as well as the software to build an interface device which connects HÃ¶rmann door drives like the Supramatic E3 to Home Assistant. The interface device emulates an UAP1 to interact with the door drive. Additionally a BME280 can be connected via I2C to measure temperature, humidity and pressure.

**NOT compatible with drives from the 4th series**

## esphome
This repo contains the esphome implementation that supports both above mentioned variants. For configuration examples see:
- [pic16: preflashed configuration](esphome/preflashed_pic16.yaml)
- [pic16: recommended configuration](esphome/recommended_pic16.yaml)

OR

- [esp and rs485 configuration](esphome/recommended_esp.yaml)

## Legacy Arduino MQTT Build

The origin Project use an Arduino sketch to add the door drive automatically to Home Assistant via [MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/).
The legacy code can be found on the [original repository](https://github.com/stephan192/hoermann_door) but have been removed from this repo as it's not maintained.

# Folder structure

* `board`: The Eagle schematic and board files
* `build`: already compiled binaries for pic16 board
* `docs`: Documentation
* `pic16`: MPLabX project. Communication with door drive via HÃ¶rmann bus
* `esphome`: implementation of the esphome components

# Thing to do first
## Alternative 1: prebuild PCB with pic16 MCU
All needed details to assemble you PCB are available in the board folder.
You can also do a jump start purchasing a fully Assembled and tested PCB
### ðŸš€ Fully Assembled PCB are for Sales on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/14yannick/uapbridge_pic16/)
The boards sold on tindie are preflased with pic16 v2 therefore support soft stop and impulse command.
1. Get a pcb
    * Optionally, get BME280 sensor pcb
    * Supply pcb with 24V via pins 2 & 3 of `J1`
    * Check if 5V and 3.3V are fine
1. Get tools listed below
1. First flashing of `esp8266`
    * Get a cheap USB-UART converter (like the ones with a `CP210x`)
    * Connect the converter to `SV3` (RX, TX and GND)
    * Short `JP1` (Boot mode)
    * Power up board. If board was powered before reset `esp8266` by shorting `JP2`(Reset) for a short time
1. Flashing `pic16`
    * Use any Microchip programmer (PICkit3, ICD3, ...)
    * Open MPLabX and click on File -> Open Project
    * Select `pic16` subfolder (chip icon)
    * Click Clean an Build Main Project
    * Click Make and Program Device Main Project

## Alternative 2: ESP32 with RS485 Transceiver
1. Build a PCB with an RS485 converter and figure out the correct pinout
2. adjust the config in esphome according to config files listed above
3. install initial firmware of esphome from [esphome web](https://web.esphome.io/)
4. Update the device from your own esphome instance over the air

# Used tools
## Alternative 1: prebuild PCB with pic16 MCU

### Schematic and board
* Eagle 7.2.0

### ESP8266
* Arduino IDE 1.8.13
* USB-UART converter

### PIC16
* MPLabX v5.25
* XC8 v2.10
* PICkit3

## Alternative 2: ESP32 with RS485 Transceiver

### Hardware
#### Working Hardware
- esp32 devkit 4
- DC/DC 24V -> 5V Step-Down
- https://www.ti.com/product/SN65HVD72 off a salvaged board

OR
- RS485-UART Coverter HW519
#### possible working hardware
The custom boards for the Series 4 drives should also work. *But the pinout is different!*
