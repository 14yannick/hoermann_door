# hoermann_door
Control Hörmann doors drives directly via MQTT from Home Assistant

Inspired by https://blog.bouni.de/2018/reverse-engeneering-the-hormann-uap1-protocoll.html

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

# Overview

This repo contains the pcb files as well as the software to build an interface device which connects Hörmann door drives like the Supramatic E3 to Home Assistant. The interface device emulates an UAP1 to interact with the door drive. Additionally a BME280 can be connected via I2C to measure temperature, humidity and pressure.

# Folder structure

* `board`: The Eagle schematic and board files
* `docs`: Documentation
* `esp8266`: Arduino project. Communication to Home Assistant via wifi and mqtt
* `homeassistant`: configuration snippet for Home Assistant
* `pic16`: MPLabX project. Communication with door drive via Hörmann bus

# Thing to do first

1. Get a pcb
    * Optionally, get BME280 sensor pcb
    * Supply pcb with 24V via pins 2 & 3 of `J1`
    * Check if 5V and 3.3V are fine
1. Get tools listed below
1. Rename esp8266/config_template.h to esp8266/config.h and adjust to your environment
1. Add `esp8266` boards to Arduino IDE
    * Open Preferences window
    * Enter http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into Additional Board Manager URLs field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.
    * Open Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and find `esp8266` platform.
    * Click install button.
    * Select `NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)` as board
1. First flashing of `esp8266`
    * Get a cheap USB-UART converter (like the ones with a `CP210x`)
    * Connect the converter to `SV3` (RX, TX and GND)
    * Short `JP1` (Boot mode)
    * Power up board. If board was powered before reset `esp8266` by shorting `JP2`(Reset) for a short time
1. Flashing `pic16`
    * Use any Microchip programmer (PICkit3, ICD3, ...)
